<h2> What is UX Storytellying? </h2>

UX storytelling is when researchers create and utilize personas,  journey maps and other storytelling components in order to build empathy and as well get insight into users. Storytelling is also useful as a means to present ideas and gain new ones as you explore the word through the user’s eyes. To add, this process allows the whole team working on the project to be aware of the users’ needs

<h3> Key features of design:</h3>

Generally speaking, the apps I explored related to my project are all extremely limiting so the functions I have focusing on will simply give users more freedom.
<ul> 
<li> An updated search function that allows users to filter results using typical advanced search abilities </li>
  <li>The ability to change the language of the app</li>
</ul>

<h2> Scenarios & Journey Map </h2>

<h3> William </h3>

**WHY:** <p>Inspired by taking his grandchildren on a college tour, William wants to revisit the general education classes he took during his undergraduate years. While his goal in college was always to leave with whatever degree gave him the easit path towards a high-paying career, he really found the interdisnary education he received so fascinating. He begins by asking if his college friends remember any of the textbooks they used in college. None did so now William is trying to find the textbooks on his own but he cannot remember the name, only the publisher and one word of the title. He hopes he can find it. </p>

**HOW:** <p> Having used computers professionally and leisurely, he understands well enough how to do advanced searches. Utilizing the search bar, he types in the publisher Simon Shoes  with quotation marks “” to ensure that whatever pops up in the results, has at least Simon Shoes somewhere in the description. Then without any quotation marks, he types in the year 198 since he is not sure if the book was published that year or another year. After clicking enter, the results show a list of possible titles and after scrolling for a few seconds he finds it! While the book was published in 1985, the app still listed it as well as other similar titles that have piqued William’s interest. Each title has a little star, he clicks on it to save it to a list. He will organize it later when he has the time. Still since, he found the textbook he was searching for and not only that, after he clicked on the search result to see more information. He saw that this book was a part of a list called "My Favorite College Reads". He decides to explore the app a bit more and to see if this other user has similar tastes as himself. </p>

<h3> Maria </h3>

**WHY:** <p>Maria got a new ipad for christmas from her oldest daughter. Maria had some difficulty managing her tablet since it is all in English. Maria is more comfortable with Spanish but does not want to bother her children. Lately, Maria has been wanting to discuss new books with her family but no one has read the books she has. Her daughter told her there is a social media app for books that she downloaded for her. Maria opens up the app, while joyous to already see so many books, is a bit confused on what everything says.  </p>

**HOW:** <p> Maria looks around on the opening home page to see what it has. On the bottom  she goes to her profile page and in the upper right corner, she sees a gear icon. She clicks on it and looks for anything that might help her. She notices the help me option straight away but after looking over the list of options again, she notices one one option is changing a lot. Does it come from English? To 한국어? To finally Español?- she clicks on it and scrolls down the list of languages until she sees Espanol. One again she clicks on it and a buffering icon appears as the page loads. Then, the buffering icon disappears and tells her “Ya todo esta listo! Vamos!” (translation: Now everything is set. Let’s go!” The page she is on fades out, and she is back on the language option list. She keeps clicking “back” until she is back on her profile page. Now that everything is in Spanish, she feels a bit more comfortable using the application. She decides to explore it some more. </p>
